This is a super barebones program written in 2 hours to estimate bacterial optical density for exponential growth.\
I recommend checking the OD at around 75% of the time that the program estimates it to ensure the cultures do not overgrow (might add this calculation in the future).\
The program is based on the exponential growth formula: A = P0*e^(rt). It calcualtes the r constant using the intermediate OD measurement and uses it to calculate the time t.
